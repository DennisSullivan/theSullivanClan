    <h3>Welcome</h3>
    <p>
      This is the story of an American family — its journeys, its joys, its quiet triumphs, 
      and the threads of love and duty that bind one generation to the next. 
      Inspired by the warm, human storytelling of Norman Rockwell, this archive preserves 
      the moments that shaped the Sullivan legacy.

    <h3>Our Roots</h3>
    <p>
      From small‑town beginnings to service in World War II, from wedding vows in 1946 to 
      the growing branches of a family tree, the Sullivan story is woven into the fabric 
      of 20th‑century America. These pages honor the lives of Bill and Lois Sullivan and 
      the generations who followed.
